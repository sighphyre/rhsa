                    The basic idea is to nurture an inclusive economy around the ecology of bamboo in its
                    natural life cycle. Due to the cyclical nature of the bamboo growing and harvesting, cultivating and processing
                    bamboo utilizes different operational cycles throughout the year. To meed the needs of these cycles, the Bamboo Regional Hub 
                    consists of 3 components working in synergy, to ensure year round employment. These are:

                        <br> Bamboo is planted in a grid (which varies according to species) and is watered regularly during the first year of growth. 
                        The following species are suitable for planting along the east coast of South Africa. Together they will provide the variety necessary 
                        for a network of self-sufficient Bamboo Regional Hubs.  
                        Dendrocalamus Asper – edible shoots, construction, craft; 
                        Guadua angustifolia – construction; 
                        Bambusa Bambos – landscaping (security), construction; 
                        Bambusa Multiplex – landscaping (hedges) and crafts; 
                        Beema Roxb – construction, bio fuels.
                        See our <a href="archive.html">species list </a> for more details.

                <b>Phase 2 / Year 2 - Dwelling, Water and Waste Management</b>

                <p>
                    <btext>
                        <br> As the bamboos take root, a caretaker’s dwelling (1) is built from earth technology (sandbag / CSEB / adobe), 
                        bamboo and other available timbers. A toilet is also constructed, with the septic tank (2) being located in the bamboo grove. The seepage from the septic tank is absorbed by the 
                        growing bamboo. As time goes by, you will expand the bamboo plantation with respect to indigenous life. Rain water also begins to be harvested at this time. 
                        The idea here is to create a synergy between domestic waste water and the needs of growing bamboo. The process of building serves as a skills development 
                        workshop over several weeks.

                    <btext>
                        <br> As the bamboo matures, processing infrastructure is built, and rain-water collection and capacity are upgraded. 
                        There are two streams of processing and production, one focused on propagation, the other on processing. 
                        A Bamboo Nursery (3) facilitates the reproduction of desirable bamboo species throughout the year via cuttings and 
                        other means of propagation. This enables stable seedling supply for the next Bamboo Regional Hub and a new generation of 
                        growers. A Bamboo Treatment Facility (4) will process raw bamboo into a usable construction material. Untreated bamboo 
                        only lasts 2-3 years compared to 30-40 years if treated and used undercover. The treatment facility enables experimentation 
                        of various treatment techniques, including iterations of preservation by sap displacement (Boucherie) and hot and cold 
                        soaking techniques (Boric acid and Borax solution). The most effective techniques will be documented and the process and 
                        results will be published by RHSA as open-source material. The treatment facility will be equipped for curing and drying 
                        the bamboo poles and strips.

                        <br> Once the main growing and processing infrastructure is set up, a Craft Workshop (5) is built fronting a public edge. 
                        The Craft Workshop is a space that enables the processing of bamboo into various products. Among these include daily 
                        utensils; furniture and housing components such as posts, beams, wall partitions, screens, roof trusses, doors, etc 
                        The Craft Workshop will also have a small commercial element to it, which will be context specific.
                        As we grow as a business, we aim to invest in processing technology to enable us to develop and produce standardized 
                        products. Skills development training programs for bamboo and earth construction will also take place at the Craft Workshop.
