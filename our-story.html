        <p><ttextcol><b>Our Story : Affordable housing, skills and resources for South Africa.</b></ttextcol></p> 
        <p><btext>  
            <br><b>Background</b><br>
            The founders of RHSA first met while studying at the UKZN School of Architecture in Durban, South Africa. 
            In 2018, Kanji and Dimitar formed RHSA on the premise that an inclusive and sustainable business can be built 
            around the ecology of bamboo in its natural life cycle. Our country has high levels of unemployment 
            coupled with low levels of education. As such there are vast amounts of unemployed youth who are more than willing 
            to learn about bamboo and benefit financially from it too. If only we could tap into this resource and demonstrate a way forward. <br>
            
            <br><b>Our Context</b><br>
            Despite South Africa being quite a dry country, bamboos already exist in many areas, notably along the east coast where there 
            are decent levels of rainfall. Different types of bamboos can be found in botanical gardens and public parks, but also along rail 
            sidings, highways, farmland, industrial land, river banks and so on. Not all of these plants have been identified or 
            are actually being used for anything, as far as we know. South Africa is also home to many mines and mine dumps, and it is well
            documented that bamboo can be used in soil rehabilitation (phytoremediation).<br>
           
            <br><b>South African Bamboo Culture</b><br>
            Unlike in other countries from South Asia, Indonesia and Latin America where availability and usage of bamboo is prolific, 
            only a minority of people in South Africa use bamboo to its full potential.  
            Our research and field work suggest that the rate of adoption is low due to lack of 
            knowledge about the many uses of bamboo, namely food, phytoremediation, and craft/construction. We have seen that generally people 
            have little to no knowledge about how to treat, design and build with bamboo. Places with a rich bamboo history and culture have 
            tried and tested methods and processes of working with bamboo, and so (with the help of <a href="http://bambussa.org.za/">NPO's</a>) we are aiming to facilitate skills 
            development workshops where this deep cultural knowledge will be shared with our locals.<br>
            
           <!-- <br><b>The South African Market</b><br>
            Bamboo products are becoming increasingly popular and gaining traction in the consumer and construction sectors.
            The vast majority of bamboo products in SA markets are imported, however South Africans do export some 
            bamboo products such as edible bamboo shoots. There are very few commerical farmers of bamboo. Certain       
            <a href="http://www.hsrc.ac.za/en/review/hsrc-review-jan-march-2018/bamboo-for-green-dev-sa"> studies</a> indicate that 
            bamboo activities are on the rise in South Africa<br>
            
               <br><b>Our Problems</b><br>
            1. Some of the existing bamboo in South Africa is of the invasive running species, which is likely to pose 
            an ecological threat if left unchecked. <br>
            
            2. Any bamboo that is not maintained can become a hazard (obstruction of public walkways, 
            falling across roads or powerlines for example).<br>

            3. A massive housing shortfall and general lack of economic opportunity. This is nothing short of an emergency.<br>
            
            <br><b>Our Assets</b><br>
            1. Abundant natural land, rain and sun (in KZN at least)<br>
            2. Our knowledge, determination and resolve. <br>
            3. People eager to work and learn. <br>
    
            -->

            <br><b>Our Vision</b><br>
            <u>Product Development:</u> We want to make bamboo a mainstream construction material, through <a href="https://www.agrement.co.za/">Agrément</a> certification. 
            The Agrément certification process recently made it possible to use Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEBs) in mainstream construction, 
            which has in turn led to some landmark   
            <a href="http://leadarchitects.co.za/projects/ntshongweni-albini-mission-church/">civic architecture</a> in South Africa. 
            Learning how to harness and use renewable resources makes it possible to combine earth and 
            bamboo to create a resilient humanitarian infrastructure, as seen elsewhere in the world. <br><br>
            <u>Community Development:</u> Bamboo is a labour intensive material and requires a mass labour force to be able to propagate, 
            maintain, harvest, treat, craft and distribute. This means job creation. As the industry develops, value will be added 
            to local communities through projects such as ablutions, schools, houses, and workshops aimed at skills development.       
            Our vision is to build the future South Africa by cultivating the resources around us, whilst enabling the people around us. <br>
         
            <br><b>Our Ethics</b><br> 
            Having to grow up, study and work in South Africa, we are vividly aware of the colonial and Apartheid history of this country.        
            We recognise the fact that the non-educated black South African person has been, and continues to be exploited.

            As such we are developing a bamboo development model (left) whereby resources generated will 
            be injected back into the bamboo farming communities in the form of essential services 
            (eg toilets), housing, school facilities, public community spaces and gardens, and so forth. 
            We will approach non profit organisations with similar objectives to ask for assistance in order to execute projects.
            We want to invest in, and strengthen our communities through this inclusive and dynamic business model.
